<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I study Computer Science at Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf. 
  During my Abitur (college), I specifically focused on Computer Science because I have always been fascinated by 
  the world of technology and programming. The ability to solve complex problems with creative solutions drives
  and motivates me every day. </P>

  <p>Alongside my studies, I tutor students, helping them understand Mathematics.  
    Teaching not only strengthens my own knowledge but also allows me to share my passion for technology with others. </p>

  <p>To further develop my skills, I am currently taking The Complete Web Development Bootcamp by Dr.Angela Yu. 
    This course helps me deepen my understanding of web technologies and improve my programming abilities, 
    allowing me to build modern and efficient applications.</p>
  
  <p>I am particularly excited about developing innovative software solutions and diving deep into algorithms and system architectures.
    I love learning new things, exploring modern technologies, and continuously expanding my knowledge. </p>

  <p>  In the future, I see myself in a field where I can combine my passion for Computer Science with 
    practical applications—whether in software development, research, or another exciting IT-related area. </p>
